This is the design document for PyVDrive

Data structure for slicing event data
=====================================

Container for splitters
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Splitters are stored in Mantid SplittersWorkspace.

Splitters are managed by *SampleLogHelper.SampleLogManager* in PyVDrive. 
There are two ways to define **key** for the *SplittersWorkspace*

1. *sample log's name*, 
   if the splitters are generated by sample log's value
2. *''__time__''*, if the splitters are generated by time.

Limitation
++++++++++

The way to determine the key for the splitter will wipe out the splitter that
are generated earlier with same log name or time.
