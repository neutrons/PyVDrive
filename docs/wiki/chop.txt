## Brief Description

Command **CHOP** is used to chop one or several runs by time or sample log values and optionally bin the chopped data.

### Alias

CHOP

## Examples

### Simple chop without focusing (binning)

 - **_CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, DBIN=300, BIN=0_**

   This command will 
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by every 300 seconds
   2. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   3. Save chopped workspaces to Mantid _Processed NeXus_ file


### Simple chop by time with reduction

 - **_CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, DBIN=300_**

   This command will 
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by every 300 seconds
   2. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   3. Save GSAS to /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/169173


### Simple chop by time with reduction with start and stop time

 - **_CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, DBIN=300, StartTime=xx, StopTime=xx_**

   This command will 
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by every 300 seconds starting from xx seconds and stoping at xx seconds from run start time
   2. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   3. Save GSAS to /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/169173


### Simple chop by sample log value with reduction

 - **_CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, LOG='TEMP',START=xx,STOP=xx,BinFolder='/tmp/sliced169173_**

   This command will 
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by every 300 seconds
   2. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   3. Save GSAS to /tmp/sliced169173


### Simple chop by sample log value with reduction and limited by start and stop time

 - **_CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, LOG='TEMP',START=xx,STOP=xx,STARTTIME=2,StopTime=100,BinFolder='/tmp/sliced169173_**

   This command will 
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by sample log value from xx to xx with step xx.
   1. All events before _start time_ xx is excluded
   1. All events after _stop time_ xx is excluded
   1. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   1. Save GSAS to /tmp/sliced169173


### Chopping by user-specified segments:

 - **_CHOP,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169173,PICKDATA=/tmp/mytimebins.txt,BinFolder='/tmp/sliced169173_**

   This command will
   1. Import the user specified chop time from /tmp/mytimebins.txt
   1. Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by the time segment imported
   1. All events before _start time_ xx is excluded
   1. All events after _stop time_ xx is excluded
   1. Do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
   1. Save GSAS to /tmp/sliced169173

#### Format of **PickData** (time segment)

  - Line 1 (to 1.gda):  _start_    _stop_
  - Line 2 (to 2.gda):  _start_    _stop_
  - ...
  - Line n (to n.gda):  _start_    _stop_

All the _start_ and _stop_ time are seconds from run start time. 

### Chopping and focusing with vanadium normalization:

 - **_CHOP,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169173,PICKDATA=/tmp/mytimebins.txt,VRUN=XXX_**

### Chopping and focusing with user specified masks

 - **_CHOP,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169173,PICKDATA=/tmp/mytimebins.txt,masks=[XXX.xml, YYY.xml]_**

### Chopping and focusing with user specified ROI (region of interests)

 - **_CHOP,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169173,PICKDATA=/tmp/mytimebins.txt,rois=[XXX.xml, YYY.xml]_**

### Chopping and focusing to non-default number of banks

  - The default number of banks for nED (but pre-Vulcan-X) runs is 3.
  - The default number of banks for pre-nED runs is 2.
