CHOP

Arguments
=========

Mandatory arguments
-------------------

  * IPTS: IPTS number
  * RUNS: First run number
  * dbin or loadframe
  * OUTPUT:

Optional arguments
------------------

  * NEXUS     : NeXus file name (It cannot be used with IPTS/RUNS/RUNE)
  * RUNE      : Last run number (if not specified, then only 1 run will be processed)
  * dbin      : time step for binning interval in unit of seconds
  * loadframe: chop load frame data
  * DRYRUN:   if equal to 1, then it is a dry run to check input and output
  * HELP:     the Log Picker Window will be launched and set up with given RUN number
  * bin:      focus the chopped data and exported to gsas format.
  * RUNV      : vanadium run number
  * NUMBANKS  : Number of banks in the output GSAS file
  * ROI       : Files for Mantid made region of interest file in XML format
  * MASK      : Files for Mantid made mask file in XML format
  * SAVECHOPPED2NEXUS: If equal to 1, then the chopped and reduced workspace will be save to a NeXus file. Default is 0 (as False)
  * PICKDATA  : Name of a plain text 2-column data file for start and stop time for splitters.

  * HELP      : the Log Picker Window will be launched and set up with given RUN number.
  * DBIN      : time step for binning interval
  * LOADFRAME : Chop LoadFrame log (MTSLoadFrame) along with
  * FURNACE   : Chop Furnace log (MTSFurnace) along with
  * BIN       : If bin=1, chopped data will be reduced to GSAS files
  * OUTPUT    : If specified, then the chopped files will be saved to the directory. Otherwise, these files will be saved to /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-????/shared.
  * DRYRUN    : If equal to 1, then it is a dry run to check input and output.
  * PULSETIME : 
  * DT        : the period between two adjacent time segments
  * INFO      : 
  * STARTTIME : The starting time of the first slicer.  Default is the run start
  * STOPTIME  : The stopping time of the last slicer. Default is the run stop
  * VDRIVEBIN : If equal to 1, using VDRIVE GSAS binning template to re-bin and output to GSAS.  Default is 3


Event Slicing
=============

Raw runs (event NeXus files) can be sliced by time and log values.


Time segment file
-----------------

Time segment file constain event time segments, which are noted by starting time and stopping time in seconds.
The time is relative time to the run start time.
  

Examples/Benchmarks
===================

**Pre-Vulcan-X (3-bank, nED)**

 - Simple chop by time with reduction:
   - CHOP, IPTS=20280, RUNS=169173, DBIN=300
   - Slice /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169173.nxs.h5 by every 300 seconds then do diffraction focus to each sliced segment and output as GSAS files
 - Simple chop by sample log value with reduction:
 - Simple chop without focusing (binning):
 - Chopping by user-specified segments:
 - Chopping and focusing with vanadium normalization:





**Pre-nED (2-bank)**

For each release, the following commands shall work correctly.

  * CHOP, IPTS=14094, RUNS=96450, dbin=60,loadframe=1,bin=1,DRYRUN=1

  * CHOP,IPTS=17263,RUNS=112811,DBIN=300,FURNACE=1,OUTPUT=/home/wzz/Projects/workspaces/VDrive/beta_test

    Chop the original event file by time with 300 seconds step.  The chopped data are saved to NeXus format.

  * CHOP,IPTS=17263,RUNS=112604,DBIN=150,FURNACE=1,BIN=1,OUTPUT=/home/wzz/Projects/workspaces/VDrive/beta_test/IPTS-17263/shared"

  * chop, ipts=17566, runs=136841, dbin=60, loadframe=1 

    chop, ipts=17566, runs=136841, dbin=60, loadframe=1, output=/tmp/

  * chop,ipts=19435,runs=147049,dbin=660,bin=1,loadframe=1,runv=136773

  * chop, ipts=17414, runs=109021, dbin=1200, dt=600, loadframe=1

  * chop, ipts=17414, runs=133243, bin=1, loadframe=1, pickdata='/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-17414/shared/pickdata/pickdata_1HWQAGE.txt', pulsetime=1
