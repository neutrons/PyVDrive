## Outputs

The diffraction focused data will be exported to a GSAS file.

### Default

For run with run number __RUNNUMBER__ in IPTS _IPTSNUMBER_, the exported GSAS file will be found at
```/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-$IPTSNUMBER/shared/binned_data/$RUNNUMBER.gda```.

For example for run 169186 in IPTS-20280, a GSAS file will be saved as ```/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/169186.gda```.

### User specified directory

With option _OUTPUT_, the user can specify the directory where the GSAS file will be saved to.


## Vanadium normalization and GSAS Profile calibration [1]

VULCAN's instrument team generates a pair of processed vanadium GSAS file and calibrated peak profile.
They are named under the same vanadium run number and stored in _/SNS/VULCAN/shared/..._.

Thus with argument **VRUN** given, the output GSAS will be
 1. normalized by vanadium spectra
 2. the paired IPARM file will be written to output GSAS file.


## TAG [2]

_TAG_ is the flag to process standard samples, such as vanadium and silicon.
So far, there are a few standards supported, including 'C', 'V', 'Si' and 'CeO2'. 

With _TAG_ specified, the reduced GSAS file will be copied to certain directories and its sample log summary will be
also recorded to the log summary file for this type of material only.

Here is the examples:

  -  TAG='V': Vanadium
  	- GSAS data file is copied to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Vanadium
  	- Log summary is written to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Vanadium/VRecord.txt


  -  TAG='Si': Silicon
  	- GSAS data file is copied to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Si
  	- Log summary is written to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Si/SiRecord.txt


  -  TAG='C': diamond 
  	- GSAS data file is copied to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/C
  	- Log summary is written to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Vanadium/CRecord.txt


  -  TAG='CeO2': 
  	- GSAS data file is copied to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/CeO2
  	- Log summary is written to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/Calibrationfiles/Instrument/Standard/Vanadium/CeO2Record.txt


## Examples (Benchmark)

### Pre-Vulcan-X examples (3-banks nED)

Date: From 2018.06.30

Test NeXus file: /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/nexus/VULCAN_169186.nxs.h5

 - Simple binning:
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186
   ```
   * Output directory: by default the result will be written to ```/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/```
   * Output file: ```169186.gda```

 - Simple binning with user specified GSAS IPARM file and normalized by vanadium file
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186, iparam=VULCAN_20180230.prm, runv=12345
   ```
   * Output directory: by default the result will be written to ```/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/```
   * Output file: ```169186.gda```

 - Multiple run binning: 
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186, RUNE=169188
   ```
   * Output directory: by default the result will be written to ```/SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/```
   * Output file: ```169186.gda```, ```169187.gda```, ```169188.gda```

 - Binning for standard (Si, V): 
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186,tag='Si'
   ```
   * Output directory: the defalt output directory /SNS/VULCAN/IPTS-20280/shared/binned_data/
   * Standard sample directory: besides the defalt output directory, a copy of GSAS file will be saved to /SNS/VULCAN/shared/CALIBRATION/.....
   * Output file: ```169186.gda```
 
 - Binning with multiple mask: 
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186,RUNE=161976, mask=[tests/data/highangle_roi_0607.xml, tests/data/highangle_roi_0608.xml]
   ```
   Two masks, defined in individual Mantid compatible XML mask files, will be applied.
 
 - Binning with multiple region of interest:
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186,RUNE=161976, roi=[tests/data/highangle_roi_0607.xml, tests/data/highangle_roi_0608.xml]
   ```
   Only the pixels inside the regions of interest won't be masked.

 - Binning with user defined TOF range and bin size
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186,binw=0.002, Mytofbmin=6000., Mytofmax=32500.
   ```
   In this case, all three banks will be binned to same TOF range and resolution.

 - Binning with various pixel grouping, i.e., separating pixels into various banks: 
   ```
   VBIN,IPTS=20280,RUNS=169186,version=2, banks=27
   ```
   The 27-bank setup will seperate each east/west bank's panel into 3 banks and separate the high angle bank into 3 x 3.
