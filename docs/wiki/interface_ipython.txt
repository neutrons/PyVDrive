## Brief Description

The IPython/VDRIVE-command console UI is the main GUI of PyVDrive to reduced VULCAN data. 

## How to launch

On SNS's analysis cluster, 
1. launch a terminal
2. execute
   ```
   > vulcan.pyvdrive
   ```
3. then this UI will be launched.

## Detailed features

This UI is composed of three parts.
* IPython console at the bottom
* Logging information at top left
* Workspace information table and plotting canvas at top right

### IPython console

It is extended from a standard IPython console.  Such that
* It supports regular Python script.
* It supports VDRIVE's IDL commands including VBIN, CHOP, VPEAK, MERGE and VIEW.
* It supports several customized commands including _plot_, _vhelp_ (for command line help), _clear_ and _exit_.

### Logging information

It contains 3 tabs.
* General information logging: for successful non-python commands from IPython console. Old message is cleared when new message is written to it.
* Error message logging: for failed non-python commands from IPython console.  Old error message is cleared when new message is written to it.
* Logging history: any message written to either _General information logging_ or _Error message logging_ will be appended to it and be kept.

### Workspace information table

It shows information for all the workspaces in Mantid's Analysis Data Service.  This is designed for power users and developers.

### Matplotlib canvas

Workspace data can be plot on this canvas with command _plot_.
