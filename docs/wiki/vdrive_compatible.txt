## GSAS File

### TOF binning

VDRIVE's GSAS files binned by IDL routine, which is different from Mantid's binning routine. 
In order to make a seamless connection between PyVDrive and VDRIVE,
from data reduction to data analysis,
all the workspaces created in Mantid shall be rebinned to VDRIVE's TOF binnings.

VDRIVE TOF binning is stored with a standard format in an HDF file.
The format shall be like this:

  ```
  + 'entry'
    + 'bank_map'
       + 2D vector as (bank_id, vector_index)
    + vector_index_0
       + 1D vector for TOF binning
    + vector_index+1
       + 1D vector for TOF binning
  ```

### Inside PyVDrive

Class __SaveVulcanGSS__ in __save\_vulcan\_gsas.py__ is the main algorithm to export a Mantid workspace to a VDRIVE-compatible
GSAS file.

An instance of __SaveVulcanGSS__ is initialized in the constructor of __ReductionManager__.
