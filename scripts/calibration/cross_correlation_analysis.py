# TODO FIXME NOW3 Implement

# Analyze the result from cross-correlation
# (This is intended to be used with Mantid or IPython Notebook)

# do cross-correlation with 1 fit


# do cross-correlation with 2 fit


# compare the masked workspace


# check the counts of the differently masked workspace


# investigate the masked spectra from highest counts


# plot the compared cross-correlated peaks in the background and export to PNGs
