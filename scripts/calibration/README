= Cross-correlation calibration =

== Workflow ==

1. cross_correlation_analysis.py : do cross correlation, analyze the result and output calibration file
   cross_correlation_lib.py : library for cross-correlation

2. calculate_difc.py : calculate DIFC for raw and calibrated instrument


== Task: Study the quality of cross-correlation ==

Q1: Is the masking generated from cross correlation reasonable? 

1. cross_correlation_analysis.py : main script to analyze the result of cross correlation
2. cross_correlation.py: main module to do all the cross-correlation related work
