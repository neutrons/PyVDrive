# Script 1
#
# Goal: observe the shift of the summed spectra intensity (given by pixel IDs) with option as focused/non-focused.
#
# Output: a set data in TOF-intensity
#
# Example: sum_pixels.py run_numbers=file_name pixel_range=file_name focus=1
#
# Script 2
#
# Goal: observe the counts/intensity summed from any column in 2theta angle.
#
# Output: 2theta-summed counts (or normalized intensity)
