Data structure for slicing event data
=====================================

Splitters are stored in Mantid SplittersWorkspace,
which are managed by LogHelper._splittersDict. 
The **key** for the *SplittersWorkspace* is either
*data file's base name and sample log's name*,
if the splitters are generated by sample log's value,
or *the data file's base name* only,
if the splitters are generated by time,
